# de.fac2 - FIDO U2F Authenticator Applet v1.34
*de.fac2* is a Javacard applet which implements a Fido U2F token. It was designed and implemented based on the Common Criteria Protection Profile [BSI-CC-PP-0096-V3-2018 "FIDO Universal Second Factor (U2F) Authenticator Version 3"](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Zertifikate_CC/PP/aktuell/PP_0096_0096V2_0096V3.html).

The implementation of this applet on a G+D Sm@rtCafe Expert 7.0 javacard was [certified by the BSI on May 8, 2020](https://github.com/tsenger/de.fac2/blob/master/docs/CC/1060_de.fac2_Urkunde.pdf). This repository contains all sources of the applet. However, the G+D libraries for the Sm@rtCafe platform cannot be provided here. These can only be obtained directly from G+D.
